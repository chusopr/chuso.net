<p>One of the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2006/opener.html">heroes</a> of the last 60 years has shown again his most critical side. If <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=12956">other times</a> were GNOME times, now it's <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/25/161">FSF</a> turn <a href="http://trends.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/09/27/1551253">again</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Linux has never been an FSF project, and has never even been a "Free Software" project.</li>
	<li>The whole "Open Source" renaming was done largely <em>exactly</em> because people wanted to distance themselves from the FSF.</li>
	<li>So go fight the problem [DRM] at the <em>source</em> of the problem, not in my project that has got nothing to do it.</li>
	<li>I absolutely hate how the FSF has tried to use my code as a weapon, just because I decided that their license was good.</li>
	<li><span style="font-style: normal;">[To Michiel de Boer]</span> Write your own kernel and poll which one is more popular.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people say Linux is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming">flaming</a>, others just think he's the voice representing against the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">FSF</a> what many of us think. Or may be they are just humans after <a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/People/index.shtml">all</a>.</p>
