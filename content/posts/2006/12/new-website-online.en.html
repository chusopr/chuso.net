<p>I set up my new website over PHP. I tried to improve its appareance and functionality to a less <a href="about:blank">about:blank</a> based schema, though it still need much improvements. When it become developed and tested enough I may do it <a href="http://www.opensource.org">open source</a>, but nowadays it's still too much beta and untested. It also has not much content (in fact, most of I added it for testing), more will be added.</p>

<p>Mid term planned improvements include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interface improvement</li>
  <li>Configurable by visitor remembering its settings</li>
  <li>Add support to <a href="http://www.mysql.org">MySQL</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Long term planned improvements include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Statistics</li>
  <li>Posting comments and publishing content by more than one user</li>
</ul>
