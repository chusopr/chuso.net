<p>A skinned horse being ridden by a jockey with the front and the back separated to see inside, a pregnant woman with the womb cut away to show the unborn fetus, a swimmer with halves swimming away from each other... these are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/gallery/image/0,8543,-10204376686,00.html">examples</a> of some of the things you can see at <a href="http://www.bodyworlds.com">Body Worlds</a>, an exhibition of the German anatomist Gunther von Hagens made with donated real corpses prepared with a technique invented by himself to be able to exhibit the bodies called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastination">plastination</a>.

<p>Creative art or macabre morbidity? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Worlds#Controversies">controversy</a>, of course, has not kept us expecting.</p>
