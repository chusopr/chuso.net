<p>Do you remember the web 15 years ago? The advertisements were almost unknown, like <i>spaghetti webs</i>. As the web became more popular and with the dot-com <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">boom</a> it was needed a way to finance so much hype, and then was when massive advertisements arrived.</p>

<p>Nowadays we are in a situation where, except some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blogs</a> and personal webpages is hard to find a webpage which doesn't have, at least, some <a href="http://adsense.google.com">Adsense block</a>, which is not the worse we can find, because then there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_ad">pop-ups</a>, ads trying to install <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">malware</a> or that epileptic <a href="http://content.yieldmanager.edgesuite.net/atoms/71/52/71524c7f957293c4b278570c7c0ad0c1.gif">scams</a>. And cases like <a href="http://www.terra.es">Terra</a>, which joins many of the features cited previously (spaghetti web born with dot-com bubble with a high mediatic hype and following crash) with <a href="http://advertising.microsoft.com/Rectangle">rectangle ads</a> which break its confusing layout. Or other sites with so many advertisements (usually focused on the same topic) that it's hard to find page contents.</p>

<p>All this caused the appearance in browsers of content blockers, like <a href="http://help.opera.com/Linux/9.50/en/contentblock.html">the one Opera includes</a> or those you can add to Firefox with extensions like <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">Adblock Plus</a>. However, Opera doesn't include the option to download and update blocking lists from the Internet, as Adblock Plus does, but you can find <a href="http://chuso.net/search.php?be=google&amp;q=allinurl:urlfilter.ini+filetype:ini">contents lists</a> on the Internet.</p>

<p>Since I discovered Opera content blocking I was adding URLs to mi content filter trying to <a href="http://my.opera.com/xErath/blog/2007/02/17/uril-filters-the-discipline-of-annoyan">avoid false positives</a>, and now I post it here so you can download it if you are interested. Requires restarting Opera.</p>
