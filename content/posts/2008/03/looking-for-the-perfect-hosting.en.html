<p>This is a post that was in my ToDo list 'cause I said I will leave <a href="http://sdf-eu.org">SDF-eu</a> to be hosted at <a href="http://www.hyperphp.com">HyperPHP</a> because I've read they offer free PHP and MySQL without advertisements. And according to <a href="https://en.chuso.net/changing-again.html">my latest comment</a>, it seems that I was satisfied with that server, but the story didn't finish yet. This server does include banners and pop-ups in hosted pages, but I didn't notice because I had <a href="https://en.chuso.net/blocking-advertisements-and-malware-in-opera.html">blocked</a> their advertisements.</p>

<p>Then I moved to <a href="http://www.x10hosting.com">x10Hosting</a>, where they actually offer free hosting with PHP (very limited) and MySQL and without advertisements. In fact, they offer three hosting plans: ad-free, with ads and paying. And, of course, when something goes wrong (which happens very often) the first to fall is the ad-free hosting, so my webpage was more time down than up.</p>

<p>So I finally moved to <a href="http://www.000webhost.com">000webhost</a> where they only offer free hosting without ads and, after a few months using this host, I'm really happy with them. They provide good PHP, with MySQL, cPanel, etc. Stable and with a good support service, the only objection is that it doesn't work with <a href="http://www.lynx.org">Lynx</a>, but I suppose that I should live with that.</p>
