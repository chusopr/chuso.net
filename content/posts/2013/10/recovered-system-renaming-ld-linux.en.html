<p>Yes, I know, it may be a little stupid renaming ld.so, can we skip this detail?<br />
It's not something I do very often, but that day I felt like I had to innovate or something like that.</p>

<p>But innovation was a disaster, it is not a good idea to rename a library linked using its exact path by all system dynamic executables, just to take into account if you are going to have the same idea.</p>

<p>Just in case my advice comes too late and someone else renamed ld.so library —do people really do things like that?— then let me explain how I solved it in my case. The first logical reaction is panic and thinking that you ruined the whole system and you'll have to power it off and go with a Live CD to repair it, which in the case of a server is not the best situation. But it's actually quite easy to fix:</p>
