<p>Since I don't know about any utility to free disk space and what I <a href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?rm">rm</a> to get free disk space is always the same (Portage temp files, thumbnails, kernel temp files, ...) I decided to make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick-and-dirty">quick-and-dirty</a> script with graphical interface which automates the process.</p>

<p>I named it Amelia in memory of the cleaning woman used by my teacher school to threaten us, if you are interested in this utility:</p>
