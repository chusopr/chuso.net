<p>You probably have heard some popular belief with a supposed scientific base of the type of humans use only 10% of their brains, you can kill somebody dropping a coin from a tall building, hair and nails continue growing after death or water drains backwards in the other hemisphere.</p>

<p>Surely that you have heard more than twenty, but twenty are solely those that a recently published <a href="http://www.livescience.com/bestimg/result.php?back=myths_greatwall_china_03.jpg&amp;cat=myths">document</a> (a little lacking in references) tries to solve.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Javi Moya (author de <a href="http://www.videodownloader.net">Video Downloader</a>), talks (in Spanish) about <a href="http://javimoya.com/blog/2007/01/23/paralisis-del-sueno-la-agobiante-sensacion-de-que-no-puedes-despertar/">sleep paralysis</a> which may be the case in opposition to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepwalking">sleepwalking</a>. He previously talked about when you are about to fall asleep and suddenly you jump. It's annoying, isn't it? Don't worry, <a href="http://javimoya.com/blog/2006/04/27/la-extrana-sensacion-de-que-te-vas-a-caer/">you are not the only one</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, nobody tells if we can make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">frogs a la Al Gore</a>.</p>
