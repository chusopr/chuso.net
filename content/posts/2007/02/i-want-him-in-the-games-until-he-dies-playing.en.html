<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(film)">Tron</a> (1981) (is from where I took the phrase for the title) was one of the first movies to use scenes generated by computer. This movie talks about "life" inside computers. Characters live games as if they were real and the game seen in the video has been developed for PC becoming very popular and one of my favorites for Linux. Yes, there are games for Linux although many people says that you can't play in Linux. In fact, I have made a list of Linux games which I was going to post here, but since it became very large, I published it in documents section.</p>
