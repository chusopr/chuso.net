<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a> was a popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_protocol">protocol</a> to sort information developed by <a href="http://www.umn.edu">University of Minnesota</a> in 1991.
It became almost extinct by the success of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/es/HTTP">HTTP</a> (although both appeared at the same time), it's more useful to mantain a sorted accesible documents repository. It's a space free from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_ad">pop-ups</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">malware</a> and abusive ads, whose simple interface makes it easy to adapt the contents for handicapped people or limited devices
such as cell phones or PDAs. Since it was quite popular about 15 years ago, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browsers</a> usually <a href="http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher://gopher.floodgap.com:70/0/gopher/wbgopher">include</a> Gopher support, but some stop to support it getting broken Gopher implementations. If your browser doesn't support it, you can use <a href="http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw">Floodgap Gopher Gateway</a>.</p>

<p>Now I've just started my own gopherspace to archive those documents I find interesting. My contribution to keep Gopher alive. You can go to my gopherspace in the left menu, even if your browser lacks Gopher support, then it will use Floodgap (if you have enabled <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>).</p>
