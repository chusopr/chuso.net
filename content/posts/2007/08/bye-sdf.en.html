<p>I've announced in <a href="https://es.chuso.net/losestores-com-tienda-online-de-persianas.html">LosEstores.com opening</a> that it was entirely made with free software and it was hosted in a not-for-profit server managed by a community of UNIX users. Finally, this final point is no longer true.</p>

<p>First, they came the attacks against the server (it's not their fault, but doesn't help), then the constant hangups and finally our service is suspended without notice saying that we didn't pay for July, which is false. After contacting them our service is restored without any explanation. If we add a sometimes arrogant attitude by the administrator, there are not many reasons to stay with <a href="http://sdf1.org">SDF</a>. It may be a good service for personal use, but unlucky for commercial use.</p>

<p>But in SDF we had some services that are hard to find in commercial servers, but not impossible, it was how I found <a href="http://www.modwest.com/index.phtml?ref=estores">Modwest</a>, that offers us all we need by a lower price: Apache, PHP 4/5, MySQL 4/5, SSH, SVN, ImageMagick, DNS and VHosts, as other features like being able to edit php.ini file and an excellent <a href="http://www.modwest.com/help/?ref=estores">support section</a>.</p>
