<p>Do you remember? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Sony_BMG_CD_copy_protection_scandal">infamous case</a> of Sony
slipping us a <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit">rootkit</a></i> with <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004144.php">some</a> of their audio CDs that includes the issue that <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/xcp_drm.shtml">hides</a> files and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry">registry</a> entries beginning with <var>$sys$</var>, even with registry editors and some antivirus, giving the work done to virii, trojans and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">malware</a>. The scandal was immediate and the story spread widely, this is why now sounds so surprising that Sony tried the same again, this time with its USB memory sticks. It was discovered by <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-082007.html#00001263">F-Secure</a> and heard by McAfee that showed its perplexity about Sony hitting the same stone twice and <a href="http://www.avertlabs.com/research/blog/index.php/2007/08/28/hide-me-sony-one-more-time">shows us</a> that this time is even easier: it even isn't needed the user to install Sony's rootkit in order to take its advantages to <i>virii scene</i>, since this time the way they hide the rootkit (of course, at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Programming_Interface">API</a> layer, so antivirus can't reach it) is with an executable file that blocks access to the directory it's executed from. Proved <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHMqSmZUc54">by a video</a> that executing it in <var>%windir%</var> blocks access to the entire directory getting a useless Windows (if you'll forgive the repetition).</p>
