<p>Some times visitors arrive here googling for how to get a .1.vg domain name (yes, <a href="https://en.chuso.net/reloacting-system-dlls.html">I told you</a>, I <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">spy</a> <a href="http://www.statcounter.com">you</a>), so I'm finally going to say you how to get it, then you can stop searching.</p>

<p>You can get one at <a href="http://freedns.afraid.org">FreeDNS</a>, where you can host your domain with a free DNS service with access to A, NS, MX, CNAME, TXT, ... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_system#Types_of_DNS_records">records</a> or web forward.</p>

<p>With a free account you are allowed to register five domains (if I'm right), either a top-level domain (like a .com) or a subdomain from the <a href="http://freedns.afraid.org/domain/registry/">more than 30,000</a> they have registered as .1.vg. And giving donations you get access to TTL and wildcards and the records number quota is increased.</p>
