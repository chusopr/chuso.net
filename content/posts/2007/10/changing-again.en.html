<p><a href="http://www.losestores.com">LosEstores.com</a> said bye to <a href="http://sdf1.org">SDF</a> for those <a href="https://en.chuso.net/bye-sdf.html">reasons</a> already explained, now it's time to do the same with my web page. In addition to those problems, I had more with my page: after the server being down for two days, my webpage was blocked arguing traffic limit exceeded after transferring 5 KiB, while my quota is 10 MiB/day. A so low limit usually causes my webpage to be blocked, so I started using <a href="http://www.coralcdn.org">Coral CDN</a> cache in addition to <a href="https://en.chuso.net/coming-back.html">other measures</a> to mitigate excessive traffic. However, Coral CDN makes my site much slower and some forms stopped to work.</p>

<p>This is why I finally moved my site (with the needed changes in the code) to <a href="http://www.hyperphp.com">HyperPHP</a> where they provide free hosting with PHP, MySQL, CGIs, mail, domain hosting, ... <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and ad-free</span>.</p>

<p>Since now I'm using a free server, I also removed <a href="http://adsense.google.com">Adsense</a> advertisements, which I used to get MySQL in SDF, but now I don't need it any more.</p>

<p>Now I'm cleaning the code to move to MySQL and release the code. Since it was very annoying, I deactivated <a href="http://snap.com">snap.com</a> previews 'til I code the option to activate/deactivate it according to your preferences. I'm also thinking about redesigning the site 'cause it actually stinks.</p>
