<p>Something that is not unusual to happen: you do bad planning of your disk partitioning and you eventually find out that you have a nearly-full partition and you want to move a directory from that partition to a new disk. If you already have some experience with Linux and command line you will probably know how to safely do this from the same machine and without losing any data, but it may be something a little more difficult for less experienced users.</p>
