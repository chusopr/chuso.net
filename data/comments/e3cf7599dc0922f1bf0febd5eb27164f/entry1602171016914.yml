message: "Hi there, \r\n \r\nMy name is Daniel Todercan, and I’ll keep this quick. I’m the founder of New Light Digital, and we help people like you generate new business from their own websites (as opposed to having a brochure-type website). \r\n \r\nWould you be interested in learning more? I’d be happy to talk to you about the things we do differently. You can learn more about our services here: https://bit.ly/3l0sCqQ \r\n \r\nI am also including a valuable PDF guide for you below. \r\n \r\n25 Point Website Usability Checklist --  use it to see if your current website meets the minimum user experience requirements to show up in Google search results. Download for free here: https://bit.ly/30kVDWs \r\n \r\nLastly, if you’re not interested in a website overhaul, would you like an SEO audit for your website? It would show you how you are ranking on Google, and what issues you might have that are preventing you from ranking better. It’s free of charge, and zero strings attached. Just request it here: https://bit.ly/33iHw5R \r\n \r\nThank you for your time. \r\n \r\nDaniel Todercan \r\nFounder and Owner \r\nNew Light Digital"
