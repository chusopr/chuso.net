  It seems that nobody is able to stop [Doom9](http://www.doom9.org/) [hackers](http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/H/hacker.html). Since HD DVDs encryption system may be updated [revoking](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070407-corel-updates-windvd-to-stop-aacs-hackers.html) the widely spread key, they have [found](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=124294) another way to break the protection without previously knowing the key, so they think it's [unrevokable](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=979423&post979423). However, since at the moment this way [needs](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070415-aacs-cracks-cannot-be-revoked-says-hacker.html) some hardware and software [hacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker), it's not yet very attainable for everyone.
  
  They must realize that as soon as they release a new protection, a new crack is found, [nobody](https://web.archive.org/web/20070305233202/www.alex-ionescu.com/?p=24) is [safe](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=121866&page=5).
