message: "Everything posted made a bunch of sense. But, think about this, suppose you typed a catchier post title?\r\nI am not suggesting your content is not good, however suppose you added a title to possibly get a person's attention? I mean Why we care about \r\nParis and not about Kabul - chuso.net is \r\na little vanilla. You should glance at Yahoo's home \r\npage and watch how they create article titles to grab people interested.\r\n\r\nYou might add a related video or a picture or \r\ntwo to get readers excited about everything've written. Just my opinion, \r\nit would make your posts a little livelier."
