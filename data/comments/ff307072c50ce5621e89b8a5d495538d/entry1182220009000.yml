  Hi,
  
  I've just seen your patch on the neverforum. Do you know that in the next version (currently available through SVN), there is no more limited balls in normal mode? (There's even a practice mode without limited time). May be you should use that instead of the old 1.4 (unless you want records in the nevertable).
